Introduction
========================================================

Available data suggests that regions in the far north of the Earth are
warming more quickly than other parts of the world. We can explore this
situation using ice breakup data available for some rivers in Alaska, USA.

- Local citizens have been recording ice breakup data for the Nenana River
since 1917
- Ice breakup is an important time of transition for communities that rely
on these rivers for transportation, subsistence hunting and fishing, and
other needs
- Early thawing can lead to severe ice movement, jamming, damage to
infrastructure, and destructive floods
